# for-DSP-IP
This repository is to submit my project to DSP-IP.
I added notes in the Jupiter notebook along with my code explaining the steps, those notes are also describe what I have leanred along this project.

I hope that my work is adequate for this course and I would like to get a feedback if possible.

I mainly learned from seaborn and scikit documentation how to accomplish this project.
